      <p class="main_text">An online marketplace (or online e-commerce marketplace) is
        a type of e-commerce site where product or service information is provided by multiple third
        parties,
        whereas transactions are processed by the marketplace operator. Online marketplaces are the
        primary type of multichannel ecommerce and can be a way to streamline the production
        process.
        In an online marketplace, consumer transactions are processed by the marketplace operator
        and then delivered and fulfilled by the participating retailers or wholesalers (often called
        drop shipping). Other capabilities might include auctioning (forward or reverse), catalogs,
        ordering, wanted advertisement, trading exchange functionality and capabilities like RFQ,
        RFI or RFP.
        These type of sites allow users to register and sell single items to many items for a
        "post-selling" fee.
        In general, because marketplaces aggregate products from a wide array of providers,
        selection is usually more wide, and availability is higher than in vendor-specific online
        retail stores.
        Since 2014, online marketplaces are abundant since organized marketplaces are sought after.
        Some have a wide variety of general interest products that cater to almost all the needs of
        the
        consumers, however, some are consumer specific and cater to a particular segment only. Not
        only is the platform for selling online, but the user interface and user experience matters.
        People tend to log on to online marketplaces that are organized and products are much more
        accessible to them.</p>
